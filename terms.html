    <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">SilvaCruise — The Ultimate Forester's Tool</p>

    <h2>Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By downloading, installing, or using SilvaCruise, you agree to these Terms of Use. If you do not agree, do not use the app.</p>

    <h2>Description of Service</h2>
    <p>SilvaCruise is a mobile application for timber cruising, forest mensuration, and forestry field data collection. It provides tools for basal area estimation, volume calculations, statistical analysis, and reference materials for professional foresters.</p>

    <h2>Professional Use Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>SilvaCruise is a field tool designed to assist professional foresters. While the calculations and reference data are based on established forestry methods and published sources (including USFS, WA DNR, and Cal Fire references), all outputs are estimates and approximations — not exact measurements. The app does not replace professional judgment. All timber cruise results, volume estimates, defect assessments, and statistical analyses should be reviewed by a qualified forester before use in official reports, timber sale appraisals, contract administration, or regulatory submissions.</p>

    <h2>Accuracy of Calculations & Estimates</h2>
    <p>SilvaCruise uses standard forestry formulas, published volume tables, and established mensuration methods. However, all outputs are <strong>estimates</strong>, not exact measurements. Users should understand the following limitations:</p>

    <p><strong>Volume estimates</strong> are derived from regionally averaged volume tables and form class assumptions (e.g., Scribner Decimal C, Form Class 78). Actual merchantable volume depends on individual tree form, taper, bucking decisions, mill specifications, and scaling practices. Cruise volume estimates routinely differ from scaled volume at the mill.</p>

    <p><strong>Defect and cull estimates</strong> are visual approximations guided by general indicators. Actual internal defect can only be determined by cutting the tree. Cull percentages entered by the user are professional judgments, not precise measurements, and deduction standards vary by agency and region.</p>

    <p><strong>Growth and yield projections</strong> are based on historical yield tables and average site conditions. Actual growth varies by site quality, genetics, climate, disturbance history, and management regime. Projections should be treated as planning-level estimates, not guarantees of future stand conditions.</p>

    <p><strong>Statistical estimates</strong> (sampling error, confidence intervals, sample size calculations) are based on standard statistical theory and are only as reliable as the underlying sampling design, field measurements, and assumptions of the sampling method.</p>

    <p><strong>Reference data</strong> including species characteristics, bark factors, slope correction factors, and conversion values are derived from published sources and represent general averages. Local conditions may differ.</p>

    <p>No software can guarantee perfect accuracy in all field conditions. Users are responsible for applying professional judgment, verifying results against applicable agency standards, and ensuring outputs are appropriate for their intended use. The developer is not liable for errors in cruise data, volume estimates, or any decisions made based on app outputs.</p>

    <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>SilvaCruise and its original content, features, and functionality are owned by the developer. Reference materials incorporated into the app are derived from publicly available government forestry publications and are used for educational and professional reference purposes.</p>

    <h2>User Data</h2>
    <p>All data you create in SilvaCruise belongs to you. The app stores data locally on your device. We do not access, collect, or have any control over your data. You are responsible for backing up your own data. Uninstalling the app will permanently delete all locally stored cruise data.</p>

    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>SilvaCruise is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. The developer shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from the use of or inability to use the app, including but not limited to: lost timber sale revenue, incorrect volume estimates, regulatory non-compliance, or data loss.</p>

    <h2>Field Safety</h2>
    <p>SilvaCruise is designed for use in remote forest environments. Users are responsible for their own safety in the field. Do not allow app use to distract from hazard awareness, including falling trees, wildlife, terrain hazards, or equipment operation.</p>

    <h2>Modifications</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.</p>

    <h2>Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of Washington, United States.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>Questions about these terms can be directed to: <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b7c4dedbc1d6d4c5c2dec4d2d6c7c7f7d0dad6dedb99d4d8da"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="9deef4f1ebfcfeefe8f4eef8
